## About

This application uses state-of-the-art source separation models to remove vocals from audio files. UVR's core developers trained all of the models provided in this package (except for the Demucs v3 and v4 4-stem models).

And this Fork is only for ROCm on Debian Based Linux.

### Linux Installation
    
**These install instructions are for Debian & Arch based Linux systems.**

- Download and save this repository [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- From the saved directory run the following commands in this order- 

**For Debian Based (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.):**
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-venv
sudo apt-get -y install python3-tk
cd /path/to/UVR
python -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
SKLEARN_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SKLEARN_PACKAGE_INSTALL=True pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt
python UVR.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If FFmpeg is not installed, the application will throw an error if the user attempts to convert a non-WAV file.
- Memory allocation errors can usually be resolved by lowering the "Segment" or "Window" sizes.

#### MacOS Sonoma Left-click Bug
There's a known issue on MacOS Sonoma where left-clicks aren't registering correctly within the app. This was impacting all applications built with Tkinter on Sonoma and has since been resolved. Please download the latest version via the following link if you are still experiencing issues - [link](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/tag/v5.6)

This issue was being tracked [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/issues/840).

### Issue Reporting
